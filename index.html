			<!-- Guidelines introduction -->
			<!----------------------------->
			<section class="category">
				<p class="description">These guidelines are designed to ensure that our community stays protected and everyone plays fairly. They set out what's allowed and not allowed within our experience. We enforce these guidelines using a combination of human reviewers and automated algorithms.<br/>
				<br/>Please take these rules seriously and take them to heart. Don‚Äôt try to look for loopholes or try to lawyer your way around the guidelines. Just understand them and try to respect the spirit in which they were created. Keep in mind, we encourage you to exercise common sense as these guidelines won't necessarily cover every possible scenario.<br/>
				<br/>By proceeding to participate within the community, you are agreeing to these community guidelines. You are responsible for your own actions; human reviewers will act under their own discretion if they believe your actions violate these guidelines. Human reviewers reserve the right to issue moderation action at any time for any reason.<br/>
				<br/>Human reviewers may issue moderation action for all activities that violate these guidelines, both on and off the Roblox platform. Furthermore, human reviewers may issue moderation action for any and all infractions, past or present.</p>

			<!-- The Two Strike System -->
			<!--------------------------->
			<section class="category">
				<h2>üìå The Two Strike System</h2>
				<p class="description">If our reviewers or automated algorithms decide that your behavior violates our guidelines, punishments will be issued.
				<br/><br/><b>The following happens once you receive a punishment:</b></p>
				
				<!-- TODO: This system likely needs revising: add in-game warning system? (two strike system becomes three strike system) -->
				<ul class="bullets">
					<li><b>First Infraction:</b> The first time a player violates our guidelines, they will receive a 30 day suspension and a full save data reset. Player will keep all Robux purchases, such as paid access rewards, developer product and gamepass purchases</li><br/>
					<li><b>Second Infraction:</b> The second time a player violates our guidelines, they will receive a permanent ban and a full save data reset.</li><br/>
				</ul>
				
				<p class="description">Punishments may be temporary or permanent bans depending on the severity of the infraction. If a suspension or ban is determined to have been issued incorrectly, it will automatically be removed by our systems in due time or by human review.</p>

				<!-- Warning message for suspension and banning decisions -->
				<!-- We should display this warning prominently since most moderation cases are fully automated -->

			<!-- Roblox Terms of Use/Standards -->
			<!----------------------------------->
			<section class="category">
				<h2>üî® Roblox Guidelines</h2>
				<p class="description">While playing our experience, you are expected to follow the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/info/terms?locale=en_us">Roblox Terms of Use</a> and <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Standards">Roblox Community Standards</a>. These terms apply to all experiences on the Roblox platform and cover a lot of the general terms and conditions that we expect players to abide by while playing our experience.
				<br/><br/><b>The following are some examples of bad behavior we may moderate:</b></p>
				
				<ul class="bullets">
					<li>Excessive bypassing the Roblox chat filter i.e. using profanity, targeted harassment, etc</li>
					<li>Usernames that are clearly intended to harass another player and serve no other purpose.</li>
					<li>Using exploits or other client-side modifications that are not authorized by Roblox.</li>
					<li>Selling in-game items for real money or Robux</li>
					<li>Misinformation relating to vaccines or other medical misinformation.</li>
					<li>References to extremist or terrorist content.</li>
					<li>Any behavior or content that encourages or glorifies self inflicted injury.</li>
					<li>Any behavior or content that reveals another players personally identifiable information.</li>
				</ul><br/>
				
				<p class="description">We take the safety and security of our community seriously and our human reviewers have a zero tolerance policy for any behavior that may inflict harm on others.<br/><br/>
				<b>For full details on the types of behavior and content that we moderate, we highly encourage you review Roblox‚Äôs <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Standards">Community Standards</a></b></p>
			</section>

			<!--------------------------------->
			<!-- Faction Specific Guidelines -->
			<!--------------------------------->
			<section class="category">
				<h2>‚öîÔ∏è Factions</h2>
				<p class="description">We allow the creation of in-game factions to allow players to create their own communities around our experience and direct community. While we support this freedom of expression, we have to ensure such freedom of expression does not pose a risk to our community. These guidelines are meant to explain what is and isn‚Äôt allowed within factions and to ensure the fairness and safety of our players and community.
				<br/><br/><b>We expect all players who are participating in factions to follow the following guidelines:</b></p>
				
				<ul class="bullets">
					<!-- TODO: A lot of these points are general common-sense; perhaps create a general category? -->
					<li><b>Appropriate Name and Icon:</b> The faction must follow the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/info/terms?locale=en_us">Roblox Terms of Use</a> by having an appropriate name and icon. Any faction found with an inappropriate name or icon risks being permanently deleted, without refund.</li><br/>
					<li><b>Ensuring Fairness:</b> All factions must ensure their gameplay remains fair for everyone involved by abiding by the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/info/terms?locale=en_us">Roblox Terms of Use</a> and <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Standards">Community Standards</a>, especially any terms governing the use of client-side exploits and/or the abuse of game glitches and bugs.<br/><br/>Any faction found to be encouraging or otherwise engaging in the use of exploits or mass-abuse of game bugs and glitches, especially for in-game advantage, risks having their faction moderated, without refund.</li><br/>
					<li><b>Do not encourage or otherwise engage in harassment of others:</b> We understand disagreements may happen however, do not repetitively continue to harass others over said disagreements. This is not okay.</li><br/>
					<li><b>Do not encourage or otherwise coordinate factions around hate speech:</b> It‚Äôs completely unacceptable to attack other people or another faction on attributes such as their race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, national origin, orientation (i.e. LGBT), religious affiliation or disabilities.</li><br/>
					<li><b>Do not evade moderation action:</b> If your faction has been previously moderated, bypassing this moderation action may only lead to further moderation action including permanent suspension of accounts involved.</li><br/>
					<li><b>Do not make threats of violence or threaten to harm others:</b> This includes indirect threats, as well as sharing or threatening to share someone‚Äôs personal information (also known as doxing).</li><br/>
				</ul>
				
				<!-- TODO: Provide a better, clear definition for "faction leadership" since vague definition allows for potential abuse -->
				<p class="description">Your faction must abide by the above guidelines. Faction leadership are responsible for ensuring all members of their faction abide by these guidelines to ensure the overall fairness and safety of their own members as well as our community.<br/>
				<br/>If any faction leadership is willfully ignoring these responsibilities, they risk having their faction disbanded if found to be in violation of these guidelines. Faction leaders are defined by their deciding power/authority within the faction, not direct ownership.<br/><br/>
				<b>For full details on the types of behavior and content that we moderate, we highly encourage you review Roblox‚Äôs <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Standards">Community Standards</a></b></p>

			<!-- Economy Specific Guidelines -->
			<!--------------------------------->
			<section class="category">
				<h2>üí∞ Economy</h2>
				<p class="description">As a player in our experience, you directly influence the economy for all other players. It‚Äôs important that we maintain our economy for everyone‚Äôs benefit and enjoyment.
				<br/><br/><b>To keep our economy secure, we prohibit the following types of behavior:</b></p>
				
				<ul class="bullets">
					<li>You may not third party trade in-game currency and items i.e. for Robux or real-life currency.</li>
					<li>Manipulate or otherwise artificially change the value of items within the economy via the use of exploits or mass-abuse of bugs, glitches or mechanics.</li>
					<li>Manipulate leaderboards via the use of exploits or mass-abuse of bugs, glitches or mechanics.</li>
					<li>The use exploits or otherwise abuse any bugs or glitches to earn cash within our experience.</li>

					<!--? Note: It's better to word this legally than to directly say "you may not scam" to provide ourselves protection -->
					<!--? We should only act upon this for notable/credible cases; such as mass-abuse, notable community public figures, etc. -->
					<li>You may not conduct fraudulent deals via any official or unofficial trading system.</li><br/>
				</ul>
				
				<p class="description">If we find that money gained in our experience is illegitimate, our human reviewers and automated algorithms may issue corrections accordingly to ensure the security and fairness of our economy.<br/>
				<br/>If you lost any money or item in connection with a Robux purchase, such as a gamepass or developer product, please contact Roblox <a href="https://roblox.com/support">Customer Support</a><br/></p>

			<!-- Anti-Cheat/Abuse Systems -->
			<!------------------------------>
			<section class="category">
				<h2>üëÆ Anti-Cheat Systems</h2>
				<p class="description">We implement various proprietary anti-cheat and anti-abuse systems to ensure the fairness of all gameplay within our experience.<br/>
				<br/>When our systems detect possible cheats, it will schedule a punishment in the future, possibly days, weeks or even months after the original detection. In addition, our systems may kick players from the game for unexpected client behavior or errors.
				<br/><br/>If cheating has been detected for a player in the past, additional restrictions may be applied to gameplay features, such as player to player trading or factions.</p>

				<!--? Note: The more vague this explanation is, the better; we shouldn't disclose too much about internal systems as bad actors are likely to use this information for reversing and profit from it -->
				<!--TODO: Maybe worth mentioning that punishments are not guaranteed to be issued for very minor violations? -->

				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>
				<ul class="bullets">
					<!-- TODO: Do we really want to provide a way to request human review? -->
					<!-- TODO: Human review requests are likely to be abused and are not worth the time -->
					<li><b>Can you tell me what caused my ban?</b><br/>No, we do not disclose the cheats/exploits that were detected that resulted in a banning decision. We have detailed information for each ban. However, we don‚Äôt release this information as this would only benefit those using and developing exploits.<br/>
					<br/>We actively review claims of false moderation to increase the overall effectiveness of our anti-cheat systems. If you feel your ban was a mistake, you may <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdsPH5egLjDHIiUVJ-XXz6MoWMG98G6o7xpsB6j6TPEiDbJlQ/viewform">request human review</a> of your case.</li><br/>

					<!--? Note: Although accounts are linked via internal fingerprint, we shouldn't issue any automated punishments for this in case of false positive -->
					<li><b>Someone else was using my account, can the ban be removed?</b><br/>No, regardless of who was using the account at the time, all suspension and banning decisions are final and will not be removed.</li><br/>

					<li><b>I was suspended, what data is cleared?</b><br/>All suspension and banning decisions come with a data reset. We reset all information that is not tied to an in-game purchase with Robux. You keep all developer products, gamepass items, paid access rewards and other Robux purchases.</li><br/>

					<li><b>Can I move my items and money to a different account?</b><br/>No, items and money cannot be moved to another account regardless if you are banned or not.</li><br/>
					
					<!-- TODO: This policy should be revised with internal moderation systems; tracking of alternate accounts is not worth the time -->
					<!--? Note: Even though likely accounts are linked by fingerprint, we shouldn't issue punishments since we honestly shouldn't care if the accounts are not violating the guidelines -->
					<li><b>Do you ban alternate accounts?</b><br/>If an alternate account has been used to bypass a suspension or banning decision, the account is likely to be banned as well.</li><br/>
				</ul>
				
				<p class="description">Suspension and banning decisions are permanent, non-negotiable, and cannot be removed by human reviewers. <!--TODO: Potentially redundant information? -->
				<br/>If a suspension or ban is determined to have been issued incorrectly, it will automatically be removed by our systems in due time or via <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdsPH5egLjDHIiUVJ-XXz6MoWMG98G6o7xpsB6j6TPEiDbJlQ/viewform">human review</a>.</p>
